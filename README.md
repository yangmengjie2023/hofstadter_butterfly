# Hofstadter Butterfly and Topological Properties

This repository explores the **Hofstadter butterfly** — a fractal energy spectrum emerging in two-dimensional electron systems under strong magnetic fields — and investigates its associated **topological invariants**, such as the **Chern numbers** of energy bands.

## Scientific Background

When a 2D periodic lattice is subjected to a uniform magnetic flux, the competition between lattice periodicity and magnetic periodicity gives rise to:
- A **self-similar fractal** spectrum (Hofstadter butterfly, 1976).
- **Nontrivial Chern numbers** associated with each energy gap (Thouless, Kohmoto, Nightingale, den Nijs, 1982).
